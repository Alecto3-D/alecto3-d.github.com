<p>
We'll be taking pictures of people and things to convert into patterns
that can be squeezed onto wax paper, graham crackers and
paper. Extrusion materials will be chocolate frosting, and if the
humidity is right, smooth peanut butter. 
</p>
<p>
If there is space, we might also be setting up a 3-D scanner or two.
</p>
<p> Possible applications for the frostruder:</p>
<ul>
<li> cake decorations</li>
<li> chocolate filigree for plate decoration</li>
<li> research tool in moss and mushroom growth</li>
<li> for culturing skin and blood tissue (with appropriate media)</li>
<li> laying down silver traces for circuits </li>
<li> ant mazes </li>
<li> edible text </li>
<li> laying down tiny rows of seeds </li>
</ul>
